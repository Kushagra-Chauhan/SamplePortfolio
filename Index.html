                    <p>We all want to live well, and when it is time, die well too. This is the
                        essence of most human aspirations. Within this, much, if not most, of
                        human endeavour is dedicated to living well, and the outcome reflects it.
                        Humans have achieved much in terms of living well. We have managed to
                        acquire more comfort and convenience than any other generation in the
                        past.

                        any way better than our ancestors. Many factors explain why humans were
                        successful with living better but not dying betterâ€”the most significant of
                        them being the disparity between the way we treat life and death in our
                        societies.
